# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to classify iris flowers into different species using machine learning.  
It uses the classic **Iris dataset**, one of the most popular datasets for beginners in data science and machine learning.

---

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers — *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.  
Using these features, we train models to predict the species based on sepal and petal length and width.

In this project, we:
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Perform data visualization and feature analysis.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models.
- Compare model performance.
